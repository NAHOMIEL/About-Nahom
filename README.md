Hey, Iâ€™m Nahom! ðŸ‘‹- a passionate Frontend Developer and UI UX Desginer, driven by curiosity,
creativity, and a deep desire to solve real-world problems through technology. Over the past year,
Iâ€™ve built strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Iâ€™ve also expanded into UI/UX Design and logo creation using tools like Figma & Adobe XD.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and personal growth. Whether it's creating clean,
responsive user interfaces or animating meaningful brand visuals, I aim to blend design and functionality to create products that stand out.
